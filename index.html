        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>A growing web designer with experience in the technology field. Currently
            living in Farmingville, Long Island. After graduating in May of 2021
            with a Bachelors Degree of Science in Computer Science at SUNY Oneonta. I began my
            journey to explore what I wanted to do. I began working in a restaurant, where I found
            a great joy in working with customers upfront. Following with the fall of 2021, I began
            working for a Computer Consultant company as a technician, where I worked in a team of 12 people.
            Each day we were tasked with sending off large amounts of unconfigured laptops each day to multiple locations.
            Starting in 2022 I undertook a Data Center contract for a major cable television company. I learned
            Using a DCIM tool, I learned much about the hardware and communication between routers,
            servers, switches and much more within the data center. In July of 2022, with the same company,
            I began working as Interconnect Opt Net-Cbl Ops, where I have been integrating, installing and
            troubleshooting network devices within the data center.
          </p>
        <p>These jobs may not share the same space as a web developer, but they
all have one attribute in common - problem solving. As a web developer, I will be able
to create complex, fascinating pages while constantly coming up with solutions
to problems for a simple, satisfying result.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I want to be able to incorporate multiple project ideas throughout this course, and be able to come up with new ideas. Learn front-end, then back-end,
          and more languages like Javascript or React. Then eventually, I would love to have an outstanding portfolio that I can show off to the world.
        having a outstanding portfolio that I can be proud of.</p>
